<h3 id="heading-curated-content" class="h3__3B1DSzXTW-ux1viDSStOux">Curated Content</h3>
<p class="p__1qg33Igem5pAgn4kPMirjw">Throughout this path you may see some items that aren’t made by the Codecademy team.  We’ve included these to ensure that you learn all the topics you need to get your career started. Though we didn’t write them, we’ve vetted them ourselves for technical accuracy and good teaching practices. When possible, we’ve written relevant assessments so that you can check your understanding back on our platform. Examples of curated content include: documentation, articles, videos, books, and tutorials. </p>

<h3 id="heading-optional-recommended-books" class="h3__3B1DSzXTW-ux1viDSStOux">(Optional) Recommended Books</h3>
<p class="p__1qg33Igem5pAgn4kPMirjw">Codecademy prides itself on its interactive lessons, but sometimes it’s useful to have a couple of books on hand. These books are considered classics in the industry and many Codecademy learners (and employees!) have found them useful.  </p>
<ul class="ul__11icM1EC_0uPj3OY0Skp4r">
<li class="li__1KqBjwbWA3ze6V0BvXq9Rx"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0" href="https://bookshop.org/books/html-and-css-design-and-build-websites/9781118008188">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites, Jon Duckett</a></li>

</ul>
<p class="p__1qg33Igem5pAgn4kPMirjw">While the books listed are recommended and will help you on your coding journey, purchasing and reading them is optional. When possible, we’ve suggested a free alternative. The content covers the same topics that you’ll find in our own lessons, but may be useful for those who want another explanation, perspective, or other opportunities for practice.</p>
<p class="p__1qg33Igem5pAgn4kPMirjw">For those who choose to use them, relevant chapters and sections are recommended in Review informationals at the end of each unit.</p>

<p class="p__1qg33Igem5pAgn4kPMirjw">Learning a programming language can be like learning a spoken language. It’s an incredible feeling when someone speaks to you and you understand what they’re saying! But it’s much more powerful when you are able to speak in response, using the new language with others.</p>
<p class="p__1qg33Igem5pAgn4kPMirjw">Coding languages work similarly. To gain mastery, you must also practice using the language.
You can start practicing what you’ve learned by visiting the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0" href="https://discuss.codecademy.com">Codecademy Community forums</a> or the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0" href="https://discord.com/invite/codecademy">Codecademy Discord Server</a>. In the community spaces, you will be able to see new posts from learners like you and test your skills by posting a response to help them. You can quickly learn about others by visiting their Codecademy Profiles, and you can introduce yourself by sharing the link to yours. </p>
<p class="p__1qg33Igem5pAgn4kPMirjw">The Codecademy Community is a great place to read about others’ experiences, ask questions, and get help from your peers when you are stuck. They are also a safe place to test out your new skills by helping someone else with their question.</p>
