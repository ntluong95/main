Well, if you want to deploy your model into production, your code will need to be more reliable than exploratory scripts in a Jupyter notebook. Writing Functions in Python will give you a strong foundation in writing complex and beautiful functions so that you can contribute research and engineering skills to your team. You'll learn useful tricks, like how to write context managers and decorators. You'll also learn best practices around how to write maintainable reusable functions with good documentation. They say that people who can do good research and write high-quality code are unicorns. Take this course and discover the magic!</p>\n",

                "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a widely used programming paradigm that reduces development times—making it easier to read, reuse, and maintain your code. OOP shifts the focus from thinking about code as a sequence of actions to looking at your program as a collection of objects that interact with each other. In this course, you’ll learn how to create classes, which act as the blueprints for every object in Python. You’ll then leverage principles called inheritance and polymorphism to reuse and optimize code. Dive in and learn how to create beautiful code that’s clean and efficient!\n",

                "You learned how to think about your code in terms of classes and objects; how to create attributes and methods. You explored inheritance and polymorphism -- two ideas that allows you to leverage and customize existing code in powerful ways. You also learned the distinction between class-level data and instance-level data. What does it mean for two objects to be equal? Turns out, it can mean anything you want, as you learned in chapter 3. You defined custom equality functions, readable string representations, even built your own exceptions. Finally, you learned what makes a relationship between classes suitable for inheritance, how Python handles private vs public data, and how to use properties to manage data access.\n",

                "So, where can you go from here? You could start by expanding your knowledge of functionality available in Python. For example, learn about mix-in classes and multiple inheritance -- a highly debated feature of Python that isn't present in many other object-oriented languages. You could learn how to override more built-in operators, like arithmetic operators, or the length operator; how to customize attribute access even more using special methods; how to create your own iterator classes that you could use to index loops. You could learn about abstract base classes used to create interfaces, or how leverage dataclasses -- a new type of class that is especially suitable for data storage.\n",

                "\n",
                "Also consider learning more about object-oriented design, which is based on SOLID principles. Solid is an acronym, and you've already learned about the \"L\" is SOLID -- the Liskov substitution principle, but the other 4 letters are just as important. Finally, I encourage you to learn more about design patterns -- reusable solutions addressing most common problems in software design.\n",
