However, as a data scientist, you'll constantly need to write your own functions to solve problems that are dictated by your data. You will learn the art of function writing in this first Python Data Science Toolbox course. You'll come out of this course being able to write your very own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. You'll gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your function writing practice. And you'll wrap up each chapter by using your new skills to write functions that analyze Twitter DataFrames.</p>\n",

There you'll learn all about list comprehensions, which allow you to wrangle data in lists to create other lists, a tool utilized by all Data Scientists working in Python. You'll also learn about iterators, which you have already seen in the context of for loops without having necessarily known it. Iterators are everywhere in PythonLand and, to put it simply, allow you to rapidly iterate Data Science protocols and procedures over sets of objects; these are a couple of the cool functionalities in PythonLand you'll encounter in the sequel to this course, which will conclude with an entire chapter devoted to a case study in which you'll apply time and time again techniques learnt in both of these courses.\n",
